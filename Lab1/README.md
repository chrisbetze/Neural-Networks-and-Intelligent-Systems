## Dataset 1: Japanese Credit Screening Data Set
### Information
Examples represent positive and negative instances of people who were and were not granted credit. 
The theory was generated by talking to the individuals at a Japanese company that grants credit.
### Preprocessing
* Missing values: We don't ignore columns with missing values. Instead in numeric data we apply mean strategy and in string data, most frequent strategy.
* Non ordinal features: Convert non ordinal and categorical features to binary vectors.
* Balanced Dataset: Dataset consists of samples 45% of first class and 55% of second.
### Classification
We compare two scikit-learn classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, kNN
### Optimization
Fine tuning using Pipeline and GridSearch techniques. Pipeline steps are PCA, Variance Threshold Selector, Standard Scaler and Random Over Sampler.
### Results
We achieve an accuracy of 92%. 
## Dataset 2: Statlog (Landsat Satellite) Data Set
### Information
The database consists of the multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods in a satellite image, and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighbourhood. 
The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number. 
The database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. 
Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. 
The number is a code for the following classes:
1) red soil
2) cotton crop
3) grey soil
4) damp grey soil
5) soil with vegetation stubble
6) mixture class (all types present)
7) very damp grey soil
